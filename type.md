## Type something

## 02/2017 in a rush and sleep deprivation

Type something  
How to end a song?  
How to know what is the worst ending?  

Standing firmly on the ground  
I am sad ...  
from no reason  

What to see, where to escape...  
The breath-taking beauty  
disappears in a blink  

They say life is a struggle  
but no one want to end it  
Is that they just enjoy watching the show  
after all?  

Close my eyes  
not to worry from all  
except the heart beat and death.  

Type something ...
