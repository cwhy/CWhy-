# Wait

Wait...  
nananana  
just one more day...  
wish would come true  

brain is  
so full  

Starts from a blink  
sucked in to a sink  
and  
nananana  
swirling and twisted.  

Just one more day  
All the plans would start  
And the fireworks  
Boom  

With the heart ignited  
and the dreaming singing  
nananana...
