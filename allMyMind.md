# All my mind

# After the "Words" incidence Aug 2019

All my mind think of dirty fabrication

of a fine-weaved tale,

of a non-exsisitent self.


All my plans have sank into perfectly riddance

for a abuntant sale,

for a doubted smile.


Swimmed in the ocean of the mood

acting career with green screen booth

"Oh yeah it's true"

And only fool the fool


All my life has been

-wait

watching my moves:

All my mind think of dirty fabrication
