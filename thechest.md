# The chest

## 10/19

* We all make different lies to cover the bitterness of the suffering of life,
 hence our insecurities. We live in the world our minds has created.
 But if there are any fragile walls of lie fallen, we crumble.

Unsettling limbs,  
mood of 10pm rush of "bad senses"  
Resurgence of fake intentions to push through  
the chest  

Is it real?  
Was it me?  
Was me it?  
What would I be?  

Dream of lifes and wishes,  
Pushing through riffs  
Playing in accord with leaves  
dead leaves  
frozen leaves  
after autumn  

Symphonize with bits of excitement  
are the fraile senses of exsistence statement.  
The chest pumps with dead cry  
the battle denied  

Is there a battle?  
Was there a fight?  
Will there be any signs?  
The chest pumps cry with questions.  

unsettling  
unsettling limbs and everything
